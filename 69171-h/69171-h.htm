<h1><span class="smcap">“Mother Hubbard’s Cupboard.”</span></h1>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SOUPS">SOUPS.</h2>

</div>

<h3>BEEF SOUP.</h3>

<p>Boil a soup bone the day before wanting it; skim the
grease off next day, and melt the jelly; add spices to taste, a
little brandy, a small teacup of butter rubbed in browned
flour, a little vermicelli, and a grated carrot.</p>

<p>Boil three eggs hard, mash smooth, put in tureen, and
pour soup over them.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Washington.</span></p>

<h3>MACARONI or VERMICELLI SOUP.</h3>

<p>Two small carrots, four onions, two turnips, two cloves,
one tablespoon salt; pepper to taste. Herbs—marjoram,
parsley and thyme. Any cooked or uncooked meat. Put the
soup bones in enough water to cover them; when they boil,
skim them and add the vegetables. Simmer three or four
hours, then strain through a colander and put back in the
sauce-pan to reheat.</p>

<p>Boil one-half pound macaroni until quite tender, and place
in the soup tureen, and pour the soup over it—the last thing.</p>

<p>Vermicelli will only need to be soaked a short time—not
boiled.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Ida Satterlee.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<h3>SPLIT PEAS SOUP.</h3>

<p>One gallon of water, one quart peas soaked over night,
one-quarter pound salt pork, cut in bits; one pound lean
beef, cut the same. Boil slowly two hours, or until the water
is reduced one-half. Pour in a colander, and press the peas
through. Return to the kettle, and add one small head
celery, chopped fine, a little parsley and marjoram. Have
three or four slices of bread, fried brown in butter, cut up
and put in the soup when served.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mrs. M. K. W.</span></p>

<h3>POTATO SOUP.</h3>

<p>Boil in one quart of water a small slice salt pork, one or
two onions, six or eight good size potatoes, boiled, mashed
fine and put with the pork and onions. Boil half an hour,
then add milk to make about as thick as peas soup. Pepper
and salt.</p>

<p>Just before taking up, add a small piece of butter; strain
through a colander.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mrs. M. K. Woodbury.</span></p>

<h3>TURTLE BEAN SOUP.</h3>

<p>One pint black beans, soaked in cold water over night;
add one gallon water, one-half pound salt pork, one-half
pound beef, one or two onions and a grated carrot. Strain
after boiling three or four hours, and add a little wine, one
lemon and one hard boiled egg, sliced, into the tureen. Pour
the soup over them.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Washington.</span></p>

<h3>NOODLES.</h3>

<p>Three eggs slightly beaten, two tablespoons of water, pinch
of salt; add flour to make a stiff dough; roll as thin as wafer,
sprinkle over flour, and roll into tight roll; cut into thin
slices and let dry for an hour before putting into soup.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span></p>

<h3>TOMATO SOUP.</h3>

<p>One can of tomatoes, one quart boiling water; strain, and
add one teaspoon soda, one pint milk, a little butter, pepper,
and salt; let it scald, not boil; add two rolled crackers.</p>

<h3>SPICED SOUP.</h3>

<p>Boil a shank bone of beef all day for a soup of four quarts;
one can of tomatoes; boil two hours, then strain; add one
teaspoon cloves, one-half teaspoon cinnamon, one-half teaspoon
allspice. Mace, pepper and salt to taste. Grated peel
and juice of one lemon.</p>

<p>One teacup brown flour, moistened with water, pour into
soup and boil half an hour.</p>

<p>One-half dozen eggs, boiled hard; chop the whites, leaving
the yolks whole; add to soup when serving.</p>

<h3>BLACK BEAN SOUP.</h3>

<p>Three pounds soup bone, one quart black beans, soaked
over night and drained; one onion, chopped fine; juice of one
lemon. Pepper, salt and Worcestershire sauce to taste.
Boil the soup bone, beans and onions together six hours;
strain and add seasoning. Slice lemon and put on top when
served.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wm. Pitkin.</span></p>

<h3>MILK SOUP.</h3>

<p>Four potatoes, two onions, two ounces of butter, one-quarter
ounce of salt; pepper to taste; one pint milk, three
tablespoons tapioca. Boil slowly all the vegetables with two
quarts of water several hours, then strain through the colander,
and add the milk and tapioca. Boil slowly and stir
constantly fifteen minutes, and it is ready to serve.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="FISH">FISH.</h2>

</div>

<h3>TO FRY BROOK TROUT, OR ANY OTHER SMALL FISH.</h3>

<p>Clean the fish and let them lie a few minutes wrapped
singly in a clean dry towel; season with pepper and salt; roll
in corn meal, and fry in one-third butter and two-thirds lard;
drain on a sieve, and serve hot.</p>

<h3>BROILED WHITE FISH.</h3>

<p>Wash the fish thoroughly in salt and water; spread it out
flat on a wire broiler; sprinkle with salt and set in a dripper
in the oven; bake twenty minutes, then brown over hot coals.
Pour melted butter over and serve.</p>

<p>A medium sized fish is preferable.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Ellen.</span></p>

<h3>BAKED FISH.</h3>

<p>A fish weighing from four to six pounds is a good size to
bake. It should be cooked whole to look well. Make a
dressing of bread crumbs, butter, salt and a little salt pork,
chopped fine (parsley and onions, if you please); mix this
with one egg. Fill the body, sew it up, and lay in large
dripper; put across it some strips of salt pork to flavor it.
Put a pint of water and a little salt in the pan. Bake it an
hour and a half. Baste frequently. After taking up the fish,
thicken the gravy and pour over it.</p>

<h4>CREAM GRAVY FOR BAKED FISH.</h4>

<p>Have ready in sauce-pan one cup cream, diluted with a
few spoonfuls hot water; stir in carefully two tablespoons
melted butter and a little chopped parsley; heat this in a
vessel filled with hot water. Pour in the gravy from the
dripping pan of fish. Boil thick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span></p>

<h3>SAUCE FOR FISH.</h3>

<p>Two ounces butter, one-half cup vinegar, one teaspoon
ground mustard, one teaspoon salt, a little pepper; let this
boil, then add one cup milk and yolks of two eggs. Let this
first boil, stirring all the time.</p>

<h3>FISH CHOWDER.</h3>

<p>Cut two or three slices of salt pork into dice pieces, fry to
a crisp, and turn the whole into your chowder kettle. Pare
half a dozen medium sized potatoes and cut them in two.
Peel a small onion and chop it fine. Put the potatoes into
the kettle with part of the onion. Cut the fish (which should
be fresh cod or haddock) into convenient pieces and lay over
the potatoes; sprinkle over it the rest of the onion, season
well with salt and pepper, and add just enough water to come
to the top of the fish. Pour over the whole a quart can of
tomatoes, cover closely, and allow about as long to cook as it
takes to boil potatoes; then add two quarts of milk, and let
it scald up again. Season with “Sauce Piquant” or tomato
catsup, and more salt and pepper if required.</p>

<p>While the chowder is cooking, break some sea-biscuit into
a pan, pour water over them, and set them where they will
soften and keep hot. Dip the chowder into the tureen and
lay the crackers on the top.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wm. N. Sage.</span></p>

<h3>CLAM CHOWDER.</h3>

<p>Twenty-five clams, one-half pound salt pork, chopped fine;
six potatoes, sliced thin; six onions sliced thin. Put the
pork in kettle; after cooking a short time, add the potatoes,
onions and juice of clams. Cook two and one-half hours,
then add the clams.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes before serving, add two quarts of milk.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mrs. J. M. Pitkin.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<h3>CLAM CHOWDER.</h3>

<p>Forty-five clams “chopped”; one quart sliced potatoes,
one-half pint sliced onions. Cut a few slices salt pork, fry to
a crisp, chop fine. Put in kettle a little fat from the pork,
a layer potatoes, clams onions, a little pepper and salt;
another layer of chopped pork, potatoes, etc., until all are in.
Pour over all the juice of the clams. Cook three hours,
being careful not to burn.</p>

<p>Add a teacup of milk just before serving.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Horace Candee.</span></p>

<h3>CODFISH BALLS.</h3>

<p>Put the fish in cold water, set on the back of the stove;
when water gets hot, pour off and put on cold again until the
fish is fresh enough; then pick it up. Boil potatoes and
mash them; mix fish and potatoes together while potatoes
are hot, taking two-thirds potatoes and one-third fish. Put in
plenty of butter; make into balls, and fry in plenty of lard.
Have the lard hot before putting in bails.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">A. M.</span></p>

<h3>CREAM OYSTERS.</h3>

<p>Fifty shell oysters, one quart sweet cream; butter, pepper
and salt to suit taste. Put the cream and oysters in separate
kettles to heat, the oysters in their own liquid, and let them
come to a boil; when sufficiently cooked, skim; then take
them out of the liquid and put in some dish to keep warm.
Put the cream and liquid together. Season to taste, and
thicken with powdered cracker. When sufficiently thick, stir
in the oysters.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">I. Teal.</span></p>

<h3>SCOLLOPED OYSTERS.</h3>

<p>Put a layer of rolled crackers in bottom of pudding dish,
layer of oysters, drained; season with butter, pepper and salt;
so on until the dish is full, then pour over coffeecup of milk.
Bake three quarters of an hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<h3>OYSTER PIE.</h3>

<p>One quart oysters, drained; pepper, salt and butter to
taste. One quart flour, two tablespoons lard, one teaspoon
salt; mix with water for pie-crust. Line the pie plate with
the crust; fill with the oysters, seasoned; put over a crust,
and bake.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Belle.</span></p>

<h3>SCOLLOPED CLAMS.</h3>

<p>Put stale bread in oven to dry; roll fine, then put in dish a
layer of crumbs, layer of clams, cut in small pieces; season
with butter and pepper; so on until dish is full. Pour over
the clam juice; bake one-half hour. Cracker crumbs may
be used in the place of bread.</p>

<h3>PICKLED OYSTERS.</h3>

<p>One quart oysters, drain off the liquid; add one cup of
vinegar, one cup of water; let it boil, and skim off the top
while boiling. One teaspoon of white pepper, one-half teaspoon
of allspice, one teaspoon of salt, little stick cinnamon.
Let the spices boil with the liquid; when cool pour this over
the oysters.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mrs. C. F. Paine.</span></p>

<h3>PICKLED OYSTERS.</h3>

<p>Two gallons of large oysters, drain and rinse them; put
one pint of the oyster juice and one quart of vinegar over
the fire, scald and skim until clear; add one tablespoonful of
whole pepper, one tablespoonful of cloves, one teaspoonful of
mace and one even tablespoonful of salt; scald a minute,
then throw in the oysters, and let them just come to a boil.</p>

<p>The oysters should be pickled the day before they are
wanted, as they grow tough after standing a few days in the
vinegar.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mrs. W. N. S.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<h3>FRIED OYSTERS.</h3>

<p>Take large sized oysters, drain and dry; dip in egg and
bread or cracker crumbs. Fry in hot butter or lard.</p>

<h3>HAM COOKED IN CIDER.</h3>

<p>Put a pint of cider and a cup of brown sugar into enough
water to cover the ham; boil three hours, or until the skin
will peel off easily. Remove the skin, cover the ham with a
crust of sugar, and bake in a slow oven three hours.</p>

<p>Dissolve a cup of sugar in a pint of cider and baste the
ham frequently while baking. If the cider is very sweet, use
less sugar.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mrs. W. N. Sage.</span></p>

<h3>STEWED BEEF.</h3>

<p>Have a steak weighing two pounds, and an inch and a
half thick. Put two ounces of butter in a stew pan; when
melted, put in the steak with one-quarter pound of lean
bacon, cut in small pieces. Place the stew pan over the fire;
turn the steak occasionally until a little brown, then lay it off
into a dish. Add one tablespoon of flour to the butter in the
pan, and continue stirring until brown; then again lay in the
steak. Add one pint of water, one glass sherry, a little
pepper and salt; let simmer slowly one hour. Skim off all
the fat, and add twenty button onions; simmer until onions
are very tender; remove the steak to hot platter, and pour
the onions, sauce, etc., over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<h3>MOCK TERRAPINS (Supper Dish).</h3>

<p>Half a calf’s liver; season and fry brown; hash it, not
very fine; dust thickly with flour, a teaspoon of mixed
mustard, as much cayenne pepper as will lie on half a dime;
two hard boiled eggs, chopped fine; a piece of butter, size of
an egg; a teacup of water. Let all boil a minute or two,

<h3>VEAL OMELETTE.</h3>

<p>Two pounds veal, and one-quarter pound salt pork, chopped
fine; one teaspoon salt, one teaspoon pepper, two crackers,

<p>Soak a teacup of bread crumbs in a cup of sweet milk over
night; three eggs, beat yolks and whites separately; mix the

<h3>POTATO YEAST.</h3>

<p>Three potatoes; boil and mash them in the morning; add
one-quarter cup sugar, one-half cup flour, a little salt; after
stirring well, pour over one-half pint boiling water; stir and
add one-half pint cold water; stir that, and add one-half cup
yeast, and put it in a warm place. When it is risen well and
rounds up to the top of the dish, stir it down. Do so several
times during the day, and at night strain and put it in a jug.
Keep in a cool place. It will be good a week.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mrs. C. J. Baldwin.</span></p>

<h3>YEAST CAKES.</h3>

<p>Boil one-half pound of hops in eight quarts of water until
the liquid is very strong; then put in fifteen or twenty large
potatoes; let them boil till they are thoroughly done; take
them out; pare and mash them fine. Put in the mashed
potatoes a pint of flour, and strain your boiling hop liquid on
to the flour and potato, taking care that the flour is well
scalded. Add one pint of molasses, one tablespoonful of
ginger and one handful of salt; when the mixture is cool
enough to put the hand in, rub it through a colander to reduce
it to a fine pulp. Add a sufficient quantity of yeast to
raise it, and let it stand in a large covered jar until morning;
then add another bowl of flour, and mix the cakes with Indian
meal. They must be hard enough to take up a quantity of
dough in the hand, pat it together and cut it into slices. Lay
the cakes as you cut them on plates or something that will
not impart any taste to them. The cakes must be turned
once the first day, and after that twice a day until they are
thoroughly dry.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Orin Sage.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<h3>YEAST.</h3>

<p>One handful hops, six large potatoes; boil together until
well done, and strain through a colander; add sufficient water
to make two quarts, and when boiling stir quickly into one
quart of flour and a little salt. When lukewarm add one cup
of yeast.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Ellen.</span></p>

<h3>POTATO BREAD.</h3>

<p>Three and one-half quarts sifted flour, one boiled potato,
large; one quart warm water, one teacup yeast, one even
tablespoon salt. Mix at night; put the flour in a large bowl;
hollow a place in the centre for the potato mashed, water and
salt. Stir in flour enough to make a smooth batter; add
yeast; stir in the rest of the flour. Put the dough on the
floured board; knead fifteen minutes, using barely enough
flour to prevent sticking. Flour the bowl, lay the dough in
it, cover, and leave to rise. In the morning, divide in four
parts; mould into loaves; when light, prick, and bake in a
moderate oven.</p>

<h3>SALT RAISING BREAD.</h3>

<p>Pour a pint of hot water in a two-quart pail or pitcher on
one-half tablespoon of salt; when the finger can be held in
it, add one and one-third pints of flour; mix well, and leave
the pitcher in a kettle of water, as warm as that used in mixing.
Keep it at the same temperature until the batter is
nearly twice its original bulk (which will be in from five to
eight hours). It may be stirred once or twice during the rising.
Add to this a sponge made of one quart of hot water,
two and one-half quarts of flour—adding as much more as
may be necessary to make a soft dough; mix well, and leave
in a warm place to rise. When light, mould into loaves,
keeping them as soft as possible; lay in buttered tins. When
light again, prick, and bake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<h3>BREAD.</h3>

<p>Five quarts flour, one tablespoon salt, two quarts lukewarm
water, one cup of yeast. Knead thoroughly, and leave in
warm place all night. In the morning make into five loaves,
and when light bake one hour.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Ellen.</span></p>

<h3>BISCUIT.</h3>

<p>Two quarts flour (full); one quart milk or water, one cup
lard, one-half cup yeast, one tablespoon sugar, salt. Melt the
lard in half the milk (or water); when it comes to a boil, pour
on the flour, thoroughly scalding the quantity it will wet;
then put in the remaining milk, cold; add the other ingredients;
mould thoroughly, like bread, and let stand to rise very
light (which will take from five to six hours); then stir down,
and put where it will be cold. As fast as it rises, work it
down, until entirely cold; then mould it, and leave where it
will be cold as possible without freezing. This dough will
keep a week, and when wanted can be rolled, cut, and baked
like soda biscuit—letting them stand to rise ten minutes on
the pans before baking.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mrs. A. A. Morgan.</span></p>

<h3>FRENCH ROLLS.</h3>

<p>One pint of milk, scalded; put into it while hot half a cup
of sugar and one tablespoon of butter; when the milk is cool,
add a little salt and half a cup of yeast, or one compressed
yeast cake; stir in flour to make a stiff sponge, and when
light mix as for bread. Let it rise until light, punch it down
with the hand, and let it rise again—repeat two or three
times; then turn the dough on to the moulding board, and
pound with the rolling-pin until thin enough to cut. Cut out
with a tumbler, brush the surface of each one with melted
butter, and fold over. Let the rolls rise on the tins; bake,
and while warm brush over the surface with melted butter to
make the crust tender.</p>

<h3>PARKER HOUSE ROLLS.</h3>

<p>One teacup home made yeast, a little salt, one tablespoon
sugar, piece of lard size of an egg, one pint milk, flour sufficient
to mix. Put the milk on the stove to scald with the
lard in it. Prepare the flour with salt, sugar and yeast. Then
add the milk, not too hot. Knead thoroughly when mixed at
night; in the morning but very slight kneading is necessary.
Then roll out and cut with large biscuit cutter. Spread a
little butter on each roll and lap together. Let them rise
very light, then bake in a quick oven.</p>

the milk is lukewarm, add the yeast; mix well, and pour into
the centre of the flour. Do not stir it. Cover and leave it in
the cellar. In the morning work it thoroughly and let rise;
two hours before tea, roll it out two-thirds of an inch thick;
cut with a tin cutter four inches across. With a feather coat
half of the top with melted butter, and lap it nearly over the
other half. Then draw them out a little, to make them roll-shaped;
lay them apart in buttered pans, and when light
bake.</p>

<h3>GENERAL DIRECTIONS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Flour</span>—Should always be sifted just before you wish to
use it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cream of Tartar, or Baking Powder</span>—Should be thoroughly
mixed with the flour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Soda</span>—Should always be dissolved in the milk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Butter and Sugar for Cake</span>—Should always be beaten
to a cream.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eggs</span>—Beat the yolks until you can take up a spoon <i>full</i>;
whip the whites to a stiff froth and stir them into the cake
with the flour the last thing before putting the flour into
the tins.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To Boil a Pudding in a Bag</span>—Dip the bag (which should
be made of thick cotton or linen) in hot water, and rub the
inside with flour before putting in the pudding; when done,
dip the bag in cold water and the pudding will turn out
easily. Always put a plate on the bottom of the kettle to
keep the pudding from burning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To Steam a Pudding</span>—Put it into a tin pan or earthen
dish, tie a cloth over the top and set it into a steamer, cover
the steamer closely; allow a little longer time than you do

<h3>CUCUMBER PICKLES.</h3>

<p>Make a weak brine, hot or cold; if hot, let the cucumbers
stand in it twenty-four hours, if cold forty-eight hours; rinse,
and dry the cucumbers with a cloth, take vinegar enough to
cover them, allow one ounce of alum to every gallon of
vinegar, put it in a brass kettle with the cucumbers and heat
slowly, turning the cucumbers from the bottom frequently;
as soon as they are heated through skim them out into a
crock, let the vinegar boil up, turn it over the pickles and let
them stand at least twenty-four hours; drain off the vinegar.
Take fresh vinegar, and to every gallon allow two tablespoons
of white mustard seed, one of cloves, one of celery
seed, one of stick cinnamon, one large green pepper, a very
little horse radish, and if you like one-half pint sugar. Divide
the spices equally into several small bags of coarse muslin,
scald with the vinegar and pour over the pickles. If you
like your pickles hard, let the vinegar cool before pouring
over them.</p>

<h3>PICKLED CUCUMBERS.</h3>

Take the cucumbers and wipe the black specks from each
one, then take sufficient quantity of vinegar to cover them,
and add a small lump of alum; put the cucumbers in the
brass kettle with the vinegar cold, heat them slowly, turning
them from the bottom several times; let them stand twenty-four
hours; afterwards take three gallons of vinegar if needed
to cover them; the size of the cucumbers vary so much,
judgment must be used. Then put three pints of brown
sugar, three gills of mustard seed, a handful of cloves, a handful
of stick cinnamon, six green peppers, one tablespoon of
celery seed, ginger root, a piece of alum the size of a walnut;
tie in a muslin bag all the spices, with the peppers, and scald

<p>One-half bushel pears, three quarts vinegar, five pounds
sugar, cinnamon to taste.</p>

<h3>SPICED BLACKBERRIES.</h3>

<p>To six pints fruit take two and one-half pints sugar, one
and one-half pints vinegar, one-half ounce cinnamon
(ground), one-half ounce cloves, one-half ounce allspice, a
little mace broken in small pieces. Boil the sugar and
vinegar together, with the spices, putting these last into
muslin bags. Then put in the berries and let them scald, not
boil.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mrs. M. K. Woodbury.</span></p>

<p class="mt2">☞ In canning fruit, to a pound of fruit allow one-fourth
to one-half pound sugar, according to taste.</p>

<h3>CANNED PINE APPLE.</h3>

<p>Pare the fruit, and be very particular to cut out the eyes.
Weigh it and chop fine. Add to it the same weight of sugar.
Mix thoroughly in a large crock, and let it stand twenty-four
hours. Then put in cans, filling them full, and seal
tight. After leaving them about two weeks it is well to
look and see if there are any signs of working. If so pour
into a pan and warm through, then replace in tin cans.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mrs. A. S. Lane.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span></p>

<h3>CANNED CHERRIES.</h3>

<p>One-fourth pound sugar, one pound fruit, one teacup
vinegar to five pounds fruit.</p>

<h3>CANNED PINE-APPLE.</h3>

<p>Three-fourths pound sugar to one pound of fruit. Pick the
pine-apple to pieces with silver fork. Scald, and can hot.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mrs. A. S. Mann.</span></p>

<h3>CURRANT JELLY.</h3>

<p>Put the fruit on and scald thoroughly; strain, and for one
pint juice allow one pound sugar; when juice boils, stir in
sugar; boil until dissolved. Pour into glasses.</p>

<h3>RASPBERRY JAM.</h3>

<p>Six pounds sugar to eight pounds fruit, one pint currant
juice, with an additional pound of sugar. Jam all together,
and boil down until a good, rich flavor. Then can.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mrs. A. S. Mann.</span></p>

<h3>ORANGE MARMALADE.</h3>

<p>Peel the oranges, and put peel in water; let boil until
tender; then with a knife scrape off the white lining, which
is bitter; then cut up peel fine. Take the oranges, divide
into sections as they separate naturally. With a pair of
scissors cut off the stringy edge in middle of piece, the seeds
will then come out easily. Chop or cut fine, and add to peel.
Then to one pint of orange, add one pound of sugar, and
boil until thick enough; it thickens a little in cooling.</p>

enough, put in a little more vinegar.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mrs. W. T. M.</span></p>

<h3>CABBAGE SALAD.</h3>

<p>Two cabbages, chopped fine; sprinkle with salt; let stand
over night. One pint vinegar, one-half cup ground mustard,
three eggs. Beat eggs thoroughly and add to boiling vinegar.
Wet the mustard with cold water or vinegar; add to the boiling

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gilbert.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span></p>

<h3>SALAD DRESSING.</h3>

<p>Yolk of one egg, salt-spoon of salt, mustard-spoon of
mustard, one cruet of oil put in very slowly, and when well
beaten add one tablespoon of vinegar.</p>

<h3>CHICKEN SALAD.</h3>

<p>Boil the white meat of two large chickens; cut it coarse,
and add the white part of celery cut coarse; a little more
chicken than celery.</p>

<h4>DRESSING.</h4>

<p>Three yolks of eggs, well beaten; one pint of oil added
drop by drop, and beaten; the juice of two lemons, one teaspoon
of dry mustard, a little cayenne pepper, a little salt.
If not moist enough beat the whites of two eggs and add to it.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Geo. Gould.</span></p>

<h3>CHICKEN SALAD.</h3>

<p>Use the white meat of two good sized chickens, and celery
enough to make the proportion one-third chicken and two-thirds
celery; boil ten eggs hard, rub the yolks perfectly
smooth with a silver spoon, adding gradually four tablespoons
of olive oil, one tablespoon of made mustard, two teaspoons
of salt, one teaspoon of black pepper, half a teaspoon of
cayenne pepper, and one tablespoon of sugar; add sweet
cream by degrees until about the consistency of batter.
Just before sending to table, mix the dressing with the
chicken and celery, and moisten with sharp vinegar. The
juice of two lemons is an improvement.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mrs. W. N. Sage.</span></p>

<h3>MAYONNAISE DRESSING.</h3>

<p>Yolks of three eggs, beaten, oil added gradually until as
stiff as cake-batter; salt-spoon of salt, lastly the white of one

<h3>VIENNA COFFEE.</h3>

<p>Equal parts Mocha and Java coffee; allow one heaping
tablespoon of coffee to each person, and two extra to make
good strength; mix one egg with the grounds, pour on the
coffee half as much boiling water as will be needed, let the
coffee froth, then stir down the grounds, and let it boil five
minutes; then let the coffee stand where it will keep hot, but
not boil, for five or ten minutes, and add the rest of the water.
To one pint of cream add the white of an egg, well beaten;
this is to be put in the cups with the sugar, and the hot
coffee added.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mrs. A. W. Mudge.</span></p>

<h3>KAOKA COFFEE.</h3>

<p>Put into an ordinary tea or coffee pot the same quantity of
K. O. K. as would be used of coffee, pour on sufficient boiling
water to extract the strength, letting boil fifteen minutes,
after which add enough boiling water for the requirements of
the family, remove from the stove and let settle for a few
moments; milk or cream and sugar to taste. It will be found
to improve by long simmering on the stove, but be sure to
let it settle before using. Do not throw away any of the
clear liquid, but heat it up again and add to the next brewing;
it is even better than the first.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span></p>

<p>Cut the berries with vinegar; let them stand forty-eight
hours. Strain them through a sieve; add one pound white
sugar to one pint of juice; boil one-half hour, then bottle.
If possible, use half red berries; they give a richer flavor,
and the black ones the color.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mrs. A. Lane.</span></p>

<h3>RASPBERRY VINEGAR.</h3>

<p>Three pints red berries; pour over them one pint cider

<h3>GENERAL DIRECTIONS.</h3>

<p>Granulated sugar is preferable. Candy should not be
stirred while boiling. Cream tartar should not be added
until the syrup begins to boil. Butter should be put in when
the candy is almost done. Flavors are more delicate when
not boiled in the candy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span></p>

<h3>CREAM FOR BON-BONS.</h3>

<p>Three cups sugar, one and one-half cups water, one-half
teaspoon cream tartar; flavor with vanilla. Boil until drops
will almost keep their shape in water; then pour into a bowl
set in cold water; stir steadily with a silver or wooden spoon
until cool enough to bear the hand; then place on a platter
and knead until of fine even texture. If too hard, a few
drops of warm water may be stirred in; if too soft, it must
be boiled again. This is the general foundation of Cream
Bon-Bons. It must be flavored with chocolate, by adding a
tablespoon of melted chocolate while the syrup is hot.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Miss Helen W. Hooker.</span></p>

<h3>CHOCOLATE CREAMS.</h3>

<p>Set one-half cake cooking chocolate on a plate or flat dish,
in the oven until soft. Prepare the cream (as cream bon-bons);
roll into small balls; leave a few moments to dry, then
roll in the melted chocolate and place on buttered paper.
Two two-tined forks will be found most convenient for rolling
in the chocolate.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">H. W. H.</span></p>

<h3>CHOCOLATE CREAMS.</h3>

<p>One-half cup water, one-half cake chocolate, two cups
sugar; flavor with lemon or vanilla. Boil the sugar and
water to a thick syrup, put aside until a little cool, then beat
to a thick cream; add flavoring and make it into balls. Dip
quickly into melted chocolate, place on buttered plate, and
put in a cool place to dry.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Miss Nellie Siddons.</span></p>

<h3>ALMOND CREAMS.</h3>

<p>Boil sugar, water, etc., as directed for cream, and when
partially stirred, add a cup of blanched almonds (chopped
fine). Treat as plain cream, and when well moulded, cut in
squares or bars. Almond cream is very nice flavored with
chocolate.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">H. W. H.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span></p>

<h3>COCOANUT CREAM.</h3>

<p>Make like almond cream, substituting grated or desiccated
cocoanut for the almonds.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">H. W. H.</span></p>

<h3>CREAM ALMONDS.</h3>

<p>Take enough of the plain cream in the hand to cover an
almond, and roll the almond up in it. Almonds thus prepared,
look and keep better, if rolled in powdered sugar.
They are very nice made with chocolate flavored cream.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">H. W. H.</span></p>

<h3>COCOANUT DROPS.</h3>

<p>One pound cocoanut (grated and dried), one pound white
sugar, two eggs (well beaten). Mix this together, make them
up pear shape; lay on a sheet of paper on a tin, about an
inch apart. Bake fifteen minutes.</p>

<h3>COCOANUT CREAM CANDY.</h3>

<p>One cocoanut, one and one-half pounds granulated sugar.
Put the sugar and the milk of the cocoanut together and heat
slowly until the sugar is melted; then boil for five minutes;
add the cocoanut (finely grated), and boil for ten minutes
longer, stirring constantly to keep from burning. Pour on
buttered plates, and cut in squares. Will take about two
days to harden.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Nellie Siddons.</span></p>

<h3>CREAM WALNUTS.</h3>

<p>Two cups sugar, two-thirds cup water. Boil without stirring,
until it will spin a thread; flavor with vanilla. Set off
into a dish with a little cold water in; stir briskly until white
and creamy. Have the walnuts shelled; make the cream into
small round cakes with your fingers; press half a walnut on
either side, and drop into sifted granulated sugar. For cream
dates, take fresh California dates, remove the stones and fill
the centre of dates with this same cream. Drop into sugar.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">A. H.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span></p>

<h3>HICKORY NUT CANDY.</h3>

<p>One cup hickory nut meats, two cups sugar, one-half cup
water. Boil sugar and water without stirring, until thick
enough to spin a thread. Flavor; set off into cold water;
stir quickly until white, then stir in the hickory nuts; turn
into a flat tin, and when cold cut into small squares.</p>

<h3>FRUIT CANDY.</h3>

<p>One cocoanut, one and one-half pounds granulated sugar
(wet with milk of cocoanut). Put in sauce pan, let it heat
slowly; then boil rapidly five minutes; add the cocoanut
(grated very fine), and boil ten minutes, stirring constantly.
Try a little on a cold plate, and if it forms a firm paste when
cool, take from the fire. Pour part of it out on to a large tin
lined with greased paper; then add to the remaining cream
one-quarter pound raisins (stoned), one-half pound blanched
almonds, one pint pecans, one-half cup chopped walnuts.
Pour over the other cream, and when cool cut in bars and
squares.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Nelson Sage.</span></p>

<h3>VANILLA CREAM CANDY.</h3>

<p>Three cups sugar, one and one-half cups water, one-half
teaspoon cream tartar, butter size of a walnut; flavor with
vanilla. Boil until it begins to thread, or until the drops are
somewhat brittle if dropped in cold water; pour into buttered
platters, and when sufficiently cool pull over a hook, or
in the hands. It may be flavored with peppermint, lemon,
&amp;c. If chocolate flavoring is desired, grate it over the hot
candy, or place some melted chocolate on it before pulling.
A pretty variety may be made by pulling the vanilla and
chocolate candies together a few times, thus leaving it striped.
Pulled candy should never be moved, after pouring into platters,
until ready for pulling. It will be sure to granulate.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">H. W. H.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span></p>

water; turn into large, flat tins, well buttered. When nearly
cold, cut into small squares.</p>

<h3>MOLASSES CANDY.</h3>

<p>Three cups yellow coffee sugar, one-half cup molasses, one
cup water, one-half teaspoon cream tartar, butter the size of
a walnut. Follow the directions for vanilla cream candy.</p>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
