<h2 class="nobreak" id="SOUPS">SOUPS.</h2>

</div>

<h3>BEEF SOUP.</h3>

<p>Boil a soup bone the day before wanting it; skim the
grease off next day, and melt the jelly; add spices to taste, a
little brandy, a small teacup of butter rubbed in browned
flour, a little vermicelli, and a grated carrot.</p>

<p>Boil three eggs hard, mash smooth, put in tureen, and
pour soup over them.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Washington.</span></p>

<h3>MACARONI or VERMICELLI SOUP.</h3>

<p>Two small carrots, four onions, two turnips, two cloves,
one tablespoon salt; pepper to taste. Herbs—marjoram,
parsley and thyme. Any cooked or uncooked meat. Put the
soup bones in enough water to cover them; when they boil,
skim them and add the vegetables. Simmer three or four
hours, then strain through a colander and put back in the
sauce-pan to reheat.</p>

<p>Boil one-half pound macaroni until quite tender, and place
in the soup tureen, and pour the soup over it—the last thing.</p>

<p>Vermicelli will only need to be soaked a short time—not
boiled.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Ida Satterlee.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<h3>SPLIT PEAS SOUP.</h3>

<p>One gallon of water, one quart peas soaked over night,
one-quarter pound salt pork, cut in bits; one pound lean
beef, cut the same. Boil slowly two hours, or until the water
is reduced one-half. Pour in a colander, and press the peas
through. Return to the kettle, and add one small head
celery, chopped fine, a little parsley and marjoram. Have
three or four slices of bread, fried brown in butter, cut up
and put in the soup when served.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mrs. M. K. W.</span></p>

<h3>POTATO SOUP.</h3>

<p>Boil in one quart of water a small slice salt pork, one or
two onions, six or eight good size potatoes, boiled, mashed
fine and put with the pork and onions. Boil half an hour,
then add milk to make about as thick as peas soup. Pepper
and salt.</p>

<p>Just before taking up, add a small piece of butter; strain
through a colander.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mrs. M. K. Woodbury.</span></p>

<h3>TURTLE BEAN SOUP.</h3>

<p>One pint black beans, soaked in cold water over night;
add one gallon water, one-half pound salt pork, one-half
pound beef, one or two onions and a grated carrot. Strain
after boiling three or four hours, and add a little wine, one
lemon and one hard boiled egg, sliced, into the tureen. Pour
the soup over them.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Washington.</span></p>

<h3>NOODLES.</h3>

<p>Three eggs slightly beaten, two tablespoons of water, pinch
of salt; add flour to make a stiff dough; roll as thin as wafer,
sprinkle over flour, and roll into tight roll; cut into thin
slices and let dry for an hour before putting into soup.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span></p>

<h3>TOMATO SOUP.</h3>

<p>One can of tomatoes, one quart boiling water; strain, and
add one teaspoon soda, one pint milk, a little butter, pepper,
and salt; let it scald, not boil; add two rolled crackers.</p>

<h3>SPICED SOUP.</h3>

<p>Boil a shank bone of beef all day for a soup of four quarts;
one can of tomatoes; boil two hours, then strain; add one
teaspoon cloves, one-half teaspoon cinnamon, one-half teaspoon
allspice. Mace, pepper and salt to taste. Grated peel
and juice of one lemon.</p>

<p>One teacup brown flour, moistened with water, pour into
soup and boil half an hour.</p>

<p>One-half dozen eggs, boiled hard; chop the whites, leaving
the yolks whole; add to soup when serving.</p>

<h3>BLACK BEAN SOUP.</h3>

<p>Three pounds soup bone, one quart black beans, soaked
over night and drained; one onion, chopped fine; juice of one
lemon. Pepper, salt and Worcestershire sauce to taste.
Boil the soup bone, beans and onions together six hours;
strain and add seasoning. Slice lemon and put on top when
served.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wm. Pitkin.</span></p>

<h3>MILK SOUP.</h3>

<p>Four potatoes, two onions, two ounces of butter, one-quarter
ounce of salt; pepper to taste; one pint milk, three
tablespoons tapioca. Boil slowly all the vegetables with two
quarts of water several hours, then strain through the colander,
and add the milk and tapioca. Boil slowly and stir
constantly fifteen minutes, and it is ready to serve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="FISH">FISH.</h2>

</div>

<h3>TO FRY BROOK TROUT, OR ANY OTHER SMALL FISH.</h3>

<p>Clean the fish and let them lie a few minutes wrapped
singly in a clean dry towel; season with pepper and salt; roll
in corn meal, and fry in one-third butter and two-thirds lard;
drain on a sieve, and serve hot.</p>

<h3>BROILED WHITE FISH.</h3>

<p>Wash the fish thoroughly in salt and water; spread it out
flat on a wire broiler; sprinkle with salt and set in a dripper
in the oven; bake twenty minutes, then brown over hot coals.
Pour melted butter over and serve.</p>

<p>A medium sized fish is preferable.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Ellen.</span></p>

<h3>BAKED FISH.</h3>

<p>A fish weighing from four to six pounds is a good size to
bake. It should be cooked whole to look well. Make a
dressing of bread crumbs, butter, salt and a little salt pork,
chopped fine (parsley and onions, if you please); mix this
with one egg. Fill the body, sew it up, and lay in large
dripper; put across it some strips of salt pork to flavor it.
Put a pint of water and a little salt in the pan. Bake it an
hour and a half. Baste frequently. After taking up the fish,
thicken the gravy and pour over it.</p>

<h4>CREAM GRAVY FOR BAKED FISH.</h4>

<p>Have ready in sauce-pan one cup cream, diluted with a
few spoonfuls hot water; stir in carefully two tablespoons
melted butter and a little chopped parsley; heat this in a
vessel filled with hot water. Pour in the gravy from the
dripping pan of fish. Boil thick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span></p>

<h3>SAUCE FOR FISH.</h3>

<p>Two ounces butter, one-half cup vinegar, one teaspoon
ground mustard, one teaspoon salt, a little pepper; let this
boil, then add one cup milk and yolks of two eggs. Let this
first boil, stirring all the time.</p>

<h3>FISH CHOWDER.</h3>

<p>Cut two or three slices of salt pork into dice pieces, fry to
a crisp, and turn the whole into your chowder kettle. Pare
half a dozen medium sized potatoes and cut them in two.
Peel a small onion and chop it fine. Put the potatoes into
the kettle with part of the onion. Cut the fish (which should
be fresh cod or haddock) into convenient pieces and lay over
the potatoes; sprinkle over it the rest of the onion, season
well with salt and pepper, and add just enough water to come
to the top of the fish. Pour over the whole a quart can of
tomatoes, cover closely, and allow about as long to cook as it
takes to boil potatoes; then add two quarts of milk, and let
it scald up again. Season with “Sauce Piquant” or tomato
catsup, and more salt and pepper if required.</p>

<p>While the chowder is cooking, break some sea-biscuit into
a pan, pour water over them, and set them where they will
soften and keep hot. Dip the chowder into the tureen and
lay the crackers on the top.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wm. N. Sage.</span></p>

<h3>CLAM CHOWDER.</h3>

<p>Twenty-five clams, one-half pound salt pork, chopped fine;
six potatoes, sliced thin; six onions sliced thin. Put the
pork in kettle; after cooking a short time, add the potatoes,
onions and juice of clams. Cook two and one-half hours,
then add the clams.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes before serving, add two quarts of milk.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mrs. J. M. Pitkin.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<h3>CLAM CHOWDER.</h3>

<p>Forty-five clams “chopped”; one quart sliced potatoes,
one-half pint sliced onions. Cut a few slices salt pork, fry to
a crisp, chop fine. Put in kettle a little fat from the pork,
a layer potatoes, clams onions, a little pepper and salt;
another layer of chopped pork, potatoes, etc., until all are in.
Pour over all the juice of the clams. Cook three hours,
being careful not to burn.</p>

<p>Add a teacup of milk just before serving.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Horace Candee.</span></p>

<h3>CODFISH BALLS.</h3>

<p>Put the fish in cold water, set on the back of the stove;
when water gets hot, pour off and put on cold again until the
fish is fresh enough; then pick it up. Boil potatoes and
mash them; mix fish and potatoes together while potatoes
are hot, taking two-thirds potatoes and one-third fish. Put in
plenty of butter; make into balls, and fry in plenty of lard.
Have the lard hot before putting in bails.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">A. M.</span></p>

<h3>CREAM OYSTERS.</h3>

<p>Fifty shell oysters, one quart sweet cream; butter, pepper
and salt to suit taste. Put the cream and oysters in separate
kettles to heat, the oysters in their own liquid, and let them
come to a boil; when sufficiently cooked, skim; then take
them out of the liquid and put in some dish to keep warm.
Put the cream and liquid together. Season to taste, and
thicken with powdered cracker. When sufficiently thick, stir
in the oysters.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">I. Teal.</span></p>

<h3>SCOLLOPED OYSTERS.</h3>

<p>Put a layer of rolled crackers in bottom of pudding dish,
layer of oysters, drained; season with butter, pepper and salt;
so on until the dish is full, then pour over coffeecup of milk.
Bake three quarters of an hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<h3>OYSTER PIE.</h3>

<p>One quart oysters, drained; pepper, salt and butter to
taste. One quart flour, two tablespoons lard, one teaspoon
salt; mix with water for pie-crust. Line the pie plate with
the crust; fill with the oysters, seasoned; put over a crust,
and bake.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Belle.</span></p>

<h3>SCOLLOPED CLAMS.</h3>

<p>Put stale bread in oven to dry; roll fine, then put in dish a
layer of crumbs, layer of clams, cut in small pieces; season
with butter and pepper; so on until dish is full. Pour over
the clam juice; bake one-half hour. Cracker crumbs may
be used in the place of bread.</p>

<h3>PICKLED OYSTERS.</h3>

<p>One quart oysters, drain off the liquid; add one cup of
vinegar, one cup of water; let it boil, and skim off the top
while boiling. One teaspoon of white pepper, one-half teaspoon
of allspice, one teaspoon of salt, little stick cinnamon.
Let the spices boil with the liquid; when cool pour this over
the oysters.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mrs. C. F. Paine.</span></p>

<h3>PICKLED OYSTERS.</h3>

<p>Two gallons of large oysters, drain and rinse them; put
one pint of the oyster juice and one quart of vinegar over
the fire, scald and skim until clear; add one tablespoonful of
whole pepper, one tablespoonful of cloves, one teaspoonful of
mace and one even tablespoonful of salt; scald a minute,
then throw in the oysters, and let them just come to a boil.</p>

<p>The oysters should be pickled the day before they are
wanted, as they grow tough after standing a few days in the
vinegar.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mrs. W. N. S.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<h3>FRIED OYSTERS.</h3>

<p>Take large sized oysters, drain and dry; dip in egg and
bread or cracker crumbs. Fry in hot butter or lard.</p>

</div>

<h3>HAM COOKED IN CIDER.</h3>

<p>Put a pint of cider and a cup of brown sugar into enough
water to cover the ham; boil three hours, or until the skin
will peel off easily. Remove the skin, cover the ham with a
crust of sugar, and bake in a slow oven three hours.</p>

<p>Dissolve a cup of sugar in a pint of cider and baste the
ham frequently while baking. If the cider is very sweet, use
less sugar.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mrs. W. N. Sage.</span></p>

<h3>STEWED BEEF.</h3>

<p>Have a steak weighing two pounds, and an inch and a
half thick. Put two ounces of butter in a stew pan; when
melted, put in the steak with one-quarter pound of lean
bacon, cut in small pieces. Place the stew pan over the fire;
turn the steak occasionally until a little brown, then lay it off
into a dish. Add one tablespoon of flour to the butter in the
pan, and continue stirring until brown; then again lay in the
steak. Add one pint of water, one glass sherry, a little
pepper and salt; let simmer slowly one hour. Skim off all
the fat, and add twenty button onions; simmer until onions
are very tender; remove the steak to hot platter, and pour
the onions, sauce, etc., over.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mrs. K. Woodbury.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<h3>MOCK TERRAPINS (Supper Dish).</h3>

very fine; dust thickly with flour, a teaspoon of mixed
mustard, as much cayenne pepper as will lie on half a dime;
two hard boiled eggs, chopped fine; a piece of butter, size of

<h3>POTATO YEAST.</h3>

<p>Three potatoes; boil and mash them in the morning; add
one-quarter cup sugar, one-half cup flour, a little salt; after
stirring well, pour over one-half pint boiling water; stir and
add one-half pint cold water; stir that, and add one-half cup
yeast, and put it in a warm place. When it is risen well and
rounds up to the top of the dish, stir it down. Do so several
times during the day, and at night strain and put it in a jug.
Keep in a cool place. It will be good a week.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mrs. C. J. Baldwin.</span></p>

<h3>YEAST CAKES.</h3>

<p>Boil one-half pound of hops in eight quarts of water until
the liquid is very strong; then put in fifteen or twenty large
potatoes; let them boil till they are thoroughly done; take
them out; pare and mash them fine. Put in the mashed
potatoes a pint of flour, and strain your boiling hop liquid on
to the flour and potato, taking care that the flour is well
scalded. Add one pint of molasses, one tablespoonful of
ginger and one handful of salt; when the mixture is cool
enough to put the hand in, rub it through a colander to reduce
it to a fine pulp. Add a sufficient quantity of yeast to
raise it, and let it stand in a large covered jar until morning;
then add another bowl of flour, and mix the cakes with Indian
meal. They must be hard enough to take up a quantity of
dough in the hand, pat it together and cut it into slices. Lay
the cakes as you cut them on plates or something that will
not impart any taste to them. The cakes must be turned
once the first day, and after that twice a day until they are
thoroughly dry.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Orin Sage.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<h3>YEAST.</h3>

<p>One handful hops, six large potatoes; boil together until
well done, and strain through a colander; add sufficient water
to make two quarts, and when boiling stir quickly into one
quart of flour and a little salt. When lukewarm add one cup
of yeast.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Ellen.</span></p>

<h3>POTATO BREAD.</h3>

<p>Three and one-half quarts sifted flour, one boiled potato,
large; one quart warm water, one teacup yeast, one even
tablespoon salt. Mix at night; put the flour in a large bowl;
hollow a place in the centre for the potato mashed, water and
salt. Stir in flour enough to make a smooth batter; add
yeast; stir in the rest of the flour. Put the dough on the
floured board; knead fifteen minutes, using barely enough
flour to prevent sticking. Flour the bowl, lay the dough in
it, cover, and leave to rise. In the morning, divide in four
parts; mould into loaves; when light, prick, and bake in a
moderate oven.</p>

<h3>SALT RAISING BREAD.</h3>

<p>Pour a pint of hot water in a two-quart pail or pitcher on
one-half tablespoon of salt; when the finger can be held in
it, add one and one-third pints of flour; mix well, and leave
the pitcher in a kettle of water, as warm as that used in mixing.
Keep it at the same temperature until the batter is
nearly twice its original bulk (which will be in from five to
eight hours). It may be stirred once or twice during the rising.
Add to this a sponge made of one quart of hot water,
two and one-half quarts of flour—adding as much more as
may be necessary to make a soft dough; mix well, and leave
in a warm place to rise. When light, mould into loaves,
keeping them as soft as possible; lay in buttered tins. When
light again, prick, and bake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<h3>BREAD.</h3>

<p>Five quarts flour, one tablespoon salt, two quarts lukewarm
water, one cup of yeast. Knead thoroughly, and leave in
warm place all night. In the morning make into five loaves,
and when light bake one hour.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Ellen.</span></p>

<h3>BISCUIT.</h3>

<p>Two quarts flour (full); one quart milk or water, one cup
lard, one-half cup yeast, one tablespoon sugar, salt. Melt the
lard in half the milk (or water); when it comes to a boil, pour
on the flour, thoroughly scalding the quantity it will wet;
then put in the remaining milk, cold; add the other ingredients;
mould thoroughly, like bread, and let stand to rise very
light (which will take from five to six hours); then stir down,
and put where it will be cold. As fast as it rises, work it
down, until entirely cold; then mould it, and leave where it
will be cold as possible without freezing. This dough will
keep a week, and when wanted can be rolled, cut, and baked
like soda biscuit—letting them stand to rise ten minutes on
the pans before baking.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mrs. A. A. Morgan.</span></p>

<h3>FRENCH ROLLS.</h3>

<p>One pint of milk, scalded; put into it while hot half a cup
of sugar and one tablespoon of butter; when the milk is cool,
add a little salt and half a cup of yeast, or one compressed
yeast cake; stir in flour to make a stiff sponge, and when
light mix as for bread. Let it rise until light, punch it down
with the hand, and let it rise again—repeat two or three
times; then turn the dough on to the moulding board, and
pound with the rolling-pin until thin enough to cut. Cut out
with a tumbler, brush the surface of each one with melted
butter, and fold over. Let the rolls rise on the tins; bake,
and while warm brush over the surface with melted butter to
make the crust tender.</p>

sugar, piece of lard size of an egg, one pint milk, flour sufficient
to mix. Put the milk on the stove to scald with the
lard in it. Prepare the flour with salt, sugar and yeast. Then
add the milk, not too hot. Knead thoroughly when mixed at
night; in the morning but very slight kneading is necessary.
Then roll out and cut with large biscuit cutter. Spread a
little butter on each roll and lap together. Let them rise
very light, then bake in a quick oven.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mrs. E. Foster Hoyt.</span></p>

<h3>PARKER HOUSE ROLLS.</h3>

<p>One quart flour, one ounce lard, one-half pint milk, one-half
gill yeast, one-half tablespoon sugar, one-half teaspoon
salt. In the evening put the flour in a bowl; put the salt and
lard in the milk, and warm until the lard is melted. When
the milk is lukewarm, add the yeast; mix well, and pour into
the centre of the flour. Do not stir it. Cover and leave it in
the cellar. In the morning work it thoroughly and let rise;
two hours before tea, roll it out two-thirds of an inch thick;
cut with a tin cutter four inches across. With a feather coat
half of the top with melted butter, and lap it nearly over the
other half. Then draw them out a little, to make them roll-shaped;
lay them apart in buttered pans, and when light
bake.</p>

<h3>GENERAL DIRECTIONS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Flour</span>—Should always be sifted just before you wish to
use it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cream of Tartar, or Baking Powder</span>—Should be thoroughly
mixed with the flour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Soda</span>—Should always be dissolved in the milk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Butter and Sugar for Cake</span>—Should always be beaten
to a cream.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eggs</span>—Beat the yolks until you can take up a spoon <i>full</i>;
whip the whites to a stiff froth and stir them into the cake
with the flour the last thing before putting the flour into
the tins.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To Boil a Pudding in a Bag</span>—Dip the bag (which should
be made of thick cotton or linen) in hot water, and rub the
inside with flour before putting in the pudding; when done,
dip the bag in cold water and the pudding will turn out
easily. Always put a plate on the bottom of the kettle to
keep the pudding from burning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To Steam a Pudding</span>—Put it into a tin pan or earthen
dish, tie a cloth over the top and set it into a steamer, cover
the steamer closely; allow a little longer time than you do
for boiling.</p>

<h3>CUCUMBER PICKLES.</h3>

<p>Make a weak brine, hot or cold; if hot, let the cucumbers
stand in it twenty-four hours, if cold forty-eight hours; rinse,
and dry the cucumbers with a cloth, take vinegar enough to
cover them, allow one ounce of alum to every gallon of
vinegar, put it in a brass kettle with the cucumbers and heat
slowly, turning the cucumbers from the bottom frequently;
as soon as they are heated through skim them out into a
crock, let the vinegar boil up, turn it over the pickles and let
them stand at least twenty-four hours; drain off the vinegar.
Take fresh vinegar, and to every gallon allow two tablespoons
of white mustard seed, one of cloves, one of celery
seed, one of stick cinnamon, one large green pepper, a very
little horse radish, and if you like one-half pint sugar. Divide
the spices equally into several small bags of coarse muslin,
scald with the vinegar and pour over the pickles. If you
like your pickles hard, let the vinegar cool before pouring
over them.</p>

<h3>PICKLED CUCUMBERS.</h3>

<h4>FOR ONE THOUSAND.</h4>

<p>Sprinkle salt and pour boiling water over for three successive
days, then prepare vinegar as follows: One-fourth
pound whole cloves, one-fourth pound cinnamon, one-fourth

sugar, a little horse radish root. Boil with vinegar ten

hours, or make a cold brine and let it stand forty-eight hours.
Take the cucumbers and wipe the black specks from each
one, then take sufficient quantity of vinegar to cover them,
and add a small lump of alum; put the cucumbers in the
brass kettle with the vinegar cold, heat them slowly, turning
them from the bottom several times; let them stand twenty-four
hours; afterwards take three gallons of vinegar if needed
to cover them; the size of the cucumbers vary so much,
judgment must be used. Then put three pints of brown
sugar, three gills of mustard seed, a handful of cloves, a handful

<h3>GENERAL DIRECTIONS.</h3>

<p>Granulated sugar is preferable. Candy should not be
stirred while boiling. Cream tartar should not be added
until the syrup begins to boil. Butter should be put in when
the candy is almost done. Flavors are more delicate when
not boiled in the candy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span></p>

<h3>CREAM FOR BON-BONS.</h3>

<p>Three cups sugar, one and one-half cups water, one-half
teaspoon cream tartar; flavor with vanilla. Boil until drops
will almost keep their shape in water; then pour into a bowl
set in cold water; stir steadily with a silver or wooden spoon
until cool enough to bear the hand; then place on a platter
and knead until of fine even texture. If too hard, a few
drops of warm water may be stirred in; if too soft, it must
be boiled again. This is the general foundation of Cream
Bon-Bons. It must be flavored with chocolate, by adding a
tablespoon of melted chocolate while the syrup is hot.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Miss Helen W. Hooker.</span></p>

<h3>CHOCOLATE CREAMS.</h3>

<p>Set one-half cake cooking chocolate on a plate or flat dish,
in the oven until soft. Prepare the cream (as cream bon-bons);
roll into small balls; leave a few moments to dry, then
roll in the melted chocolate and place on buttered paper.
Two two-tined forks will be found most convenient for rolling
in the chocolate.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">H. W. H.</span></p>

<h3>CHOCOLATE CREAMS.</h3>

<p>One-half cup water, one-half cake chocolate, two cups
sugar; flavor with lemon or vanilla. Boil the sugar and
water to a thick syrup, put aside until a little cool, then beat
to a thick cream; add flavoring and make it into balls. Dip
quickly into melted chocolate, place on buttered plate, and
put in a cool place to dry.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Miss Nellie Siddons.</span></p>

<h3>ALMOND CREAMS.</h3>

<p>Boil sugar, water, etc., as directed for cream, and when
partially stirred, add a cup of blanched almonds (chopped
fine). Treat as plain cream, and when well moulded, cut in
squares or bars. Almond cream is very nice flavored with
chocolate.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">H. W. H.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span></p>

<h3>COCOANUT CREAM.</h3>

<p>Make like almond cream, substituting grated or desiccated
cocoanut for the almonds.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">H. W. H.</span></p>

<h3>CREAM ALMONDS.</h3>

<p>Take enough of the plain cream in the hand to cover an
almond, and roll the almond up in it. Almonds thus prepared,
look and keep better, if rolled in powdered sugar.
They are very nice made with chocolate flavored cream.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">H. W. H.</span></p>

<h3>COCOANUT DROPS.</h3>

<p>One pound cocoanut (grated and dried), one pound white
sugar, two eggs (well beaten). Mix this together, make them
up pear shape; lay on a sheet of paper on a tin, about an
inch apart. Bake fifteen minutes.</p>

<h3>COCOANUT CREAM CANDY.</h3>

<p>One cocoanut, one and one-half pounds granulated sugar.
Put the sugar and the milk of the cocoanut together and heat
slowly until the sugar is melted; then boil for five minutes;
add the cocoanut (finely grated), and boil for ten minutes
longer, stirring constantly to keep from burning. Pour on
buttered plates, and cut in squares. Will take about two
days to harden.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Nellie Siddons.</span></p>

<h3>CREAM WALNUTS.</h3>

<p>Two cups sugar, two-thirds cup water. Boil without stirring,
until it will spin a thread; flavor with vanilla. Set off
into a dish with a little cold water in; stir briskly until white
and creamy. Have the walnuts shelled; make the cream into
small round cakes with your fingers; press half a walnut on
either side, and drop into sifted granulated sugar. For cream
dates, take fresh California dates, remove the stones and fill
the centre of dates with this same cream. Drop into sugar.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">A. H.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span></p>

<h3>HICKORY NUT CANDY.</h3>

<p>One cup hickory nut meats, two cups sugar, one-half cup
water. Boil sugar and water without stirring, until thick
enough to spin a thread. Flavor; set off into cold water;
stir quickly until white, then stir in the hickory nuts; turn
into a flat tin, and when cold cut into small squares.</p>

<h3>FRUIT CANDY.</h3>

<p>One cocoanut, one and one-half pounds granulated sugar
(wet with milk of cocoanut). Put in sauce pan, let it heat
slowly; then boil rapidly five minutes; add the cocoanut
(grated very fine), and boil ten minutes, stirring constantly.
Try a little on a cold plate, and if it forms a firm paste when
cool, take from the fire. Pour part of it out on to a large tin
lined with greased paper; then add to the remaining cream
one-quarter pound raisins (stoned), one-half pound blanched
almonds, one pint pecans, one-half cup chopped walnuts.
Pour over the other cream, and when cool cut in bars and
squares.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Nelson Sage.</span></p>

<h3>VANILLA CREAM CANDY.</h3>

<p>Three cups sugar, one and one-half cups water, one-half
teaspoon cream tartar, butter size of a walnut; flavor with
vanilla. Boil until it begins to thread, or until the drops are
somewhat brittle if dropped in cold water; pour into buttered
platters, and when sufficiently cool pull over a hook, or
in the hands. It may be flavored with peppermint, lemon,
&amp;c. If chocolate flavoring is desired, grate it over the hot
candy, or place some melted chocolate on it before pulling.
A pretty variety may be made by pulling the vanilla and
chocolate candies together a few times, thus leaving it striped.
Pulled candy should never be moved, after pouring into platters,
until ready for pulling. It will be sure to granulate.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">H. W. H.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span></p>

<h3>CREAM CANDY.</h3>

<p>One pound white sugar, three tablespoons vinegar, one
teaspoon lemon extract, one teaspoon cream tartar. Add a
little water to moisten the sugar, and boil until brittle. Put
in the extract; then turn quickly out on buttered plates.
When cool, pull until white, and cut in squares.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Miss N. Siddons.</span></p>

<h3>BUTTER SCOTCH.</h3>

<p>Two cups sugar, two tablespoons water, piece of butter the
size of an egg. Boil without stirring, until it hardens on a
spoon. Pour out on buttered plates to cool.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Hattie.</span></p>

<h3>CHOCOLATE CARAMELS.</h3>

<p>Three cups brown sugar, one cup milk, one-half cake
chocolate, one piece butter (size of an egg). Boil until thick;
pour in a buttered pan, and when cool cut in squares.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Nellie Siddons.</span></p>

<h3>CHOCOLATE CARAMELS.</h3>

<p>Two cups molasses, one cup brown sugar, one cup cream
or milk, one-half pound Baker’s chocolate, piece of butter
size of an egg. Beat all together; boil until it thickens in
water; turn into large, flat tins, well buttered. When nearly
cold, cut into small squares.</p>

<h3>MOLASSES CANDY.</h3>

<p>Three cups yellow coffee sugar, one-half cup molasses, one
cup water, one-half teaspoon cream tartar, butter the size of
a walnut. Follow the directions for vanilla cream candy.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
